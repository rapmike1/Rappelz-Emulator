*party exp is messed up 

*Only The leader of party is visable on party bar so if in party leader cant see anyone cept self 

*Some skill like healing stop casting on there own for no reason yet charge you mana same with healer buffs at times too 

*Cube drops seem a bit off like some monsters only drop DEF cubes tested on yeti for 20 lvls got only def cubes from them
